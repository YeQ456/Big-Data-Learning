Lab assignment: Exercises with MapReduce on Spark SQL - Dataframes
The aim of this notebook is to play with the DataFrame API of Apache Spark, aiming to solve the same MapReduce exercises we did for the previous labs.

The key difference will be the programming style, which will be more SQL-like. You should always use the functions provided by SparkSQL, I will import these functions as 'F', so we know for sure we are using Spark functions and not Python functions!

Note: I have decided to leave out the exercise about the list of common friends between pairs of friends with DataFrames. Whilst definitely possible, I don't see much point in doing so. You could try and let me know how you get on with it, but you might need to use User-Defined Functions, or other functions I didn't explain.
