# Group File Structure



## filename: main.ipynb

This file mainly contains all the code required for the project, including data preprocessing, the use of clustering algorithms, and model prediction.







## filename: randomForest.ipynb

This file mainly contains machine learning models for random forests to predict data. The unsupervised learning algorithm of Doc2Vec is used here, which can learn fixed-length feature representations from variable-length texts. This method is also known as paragraph vector or sentence embedding. This algorithm is an extension of Word2Vec, which can capture semantic information in text without requiring a fixed sentence length.
